# Harmonic-Oscilation-Length-VS-Period-2
This code graphs the theoretical period (T^2) of a pendulum versus the length of the pendulum (L) creating a straight line because of the relationship between these variables in simple harmonic motion using euler cromer method. This is then compared to a numerical soltuion solved using known equations.
